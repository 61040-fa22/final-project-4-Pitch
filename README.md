# Testing the site locally

Same as Fritter Frontend:
* run "npm run serve" on one terminal window (starting the frontend).
* run "npm run dev" on another terminal window (starting the backend).
* go to [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) to test/look around.

## NOTE:

I set up the basic structure of our repo. You are basically free to do anything inside of each folder corresponding to your assigned concepts. Just **please** have documentations that other members can read to know what your code does. Let's remind ourselves the concept of abstraction from 6.031 (no need for the users to know about actual implementations as long as preconditions/postconditions are given! Sorry to make you think about 031 again oof). 

Also whenever you edited files outside of your designated concept folder and are about to push, if possible, let's ask each other if they have edited the same file(s) too! (or if you are a git god, please teach me your ways in resolving git merge conflicts! ;-;)

But thank you!
